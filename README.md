# Nudge--Carrom
Technical Task Game 
Aim: To create a single-player Carrom game. The game should be developed in Unity and optimized for portrait screen orientation, scalable on all devices. All the assets and references are attached below.

Task Requirements:

Game Elements: Develop game elements including a striker, 8 black pucks, 8 white pucks, and 1 red queen.
Game Mechanics: Implement a mechanic where the striker can be dragged behind to charge the power of the shot, releasing it in the desired direction.
Physics: The game should follow general physics rules, especially when the pucks collide with the striker.
Boundaries: Implement appropriate bouncing off the boundaries of the board for both the striker and pucks.
Scoring: Incorporate functional pockets into the game board. When a puck is added, the score in the UI panel should increase by 1, and when the queen is potted, it adds 2 points.
Timer: Implement a 2-minute game timer. When the timer runs out, the game should display a "Game Over" banner.
AI Functionality: Create a single-player game where the bot is capable of taking simple shots.
